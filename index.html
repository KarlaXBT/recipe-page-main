          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>

      Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
      and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or
      milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan
      over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette: Once the butter
      is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs
      evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to
      set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
      chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the
      omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
      Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The
